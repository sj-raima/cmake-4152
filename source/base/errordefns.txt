comment, This file is used to define the return (status and error) codes used by RaimaDB.
comment, It is read by the perl\genErrors.pl perl script and generates two
comment, header files: rdmretcodetypes.h (which contains the error code enum typedef)
comment, and rettables.h (which contains the error description table declaration).

comment, Four statement types can be specified in this file. A "comment" line
comment, is simply ignored. Error codes are organized into separate
comment, groups which are identified by the "group" lines which contain the
comment, name of the group followed by the initial return code. The
comment, subsequent codes are automatically verified by incrementing
comment, (for status codes >= 0) or decrementing (for error codes < 0)
comment, from this initial value. You can see some of these groups below.
comment, The "status" and "general" groups defined codes that are used by all
comment, subsystems. The subsequent groups are subsystem specific.
comment, Note that the groups must be assigned in descending initial code values.
comment, genErrors will report an error for a "group" with an invalid initial code.
comment, The "code" line defines each specific return code by its (enum) name
comment, and its description. In order to preserve existing code value assignments
comment, a "code" for a deprecated return code can be changed to a "skip" line
comment, which will increment/decrement the current code but otherwise skip
comment, the code definition. New codes should, as a practice, be added to the end
comment, of its respective group in order to preserve the earlier code value assignements.
